# hello-world
reuse git under ubuntu to manage my codes
Before i used to write my codes under windows ,but because of projects of my lab,i have to switch my workspace to ubuntu.
Starting learning linux is a hard work for me ,but while using it, i fell in love with it.
Now i want to use git to manage my codes and fork others' ideas.
I think it's amazing!!!
