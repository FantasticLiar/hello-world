# hello-world
reuse git under ubuntu to manage my codes<br>
Before i used to write my codes under windows ,but because of projects of my lab,i have to switch my workspace to ubuntu.<br>
Starting learning linux is a hard work for me ,but while using it, i fell in love with it.<br>
Now i want to use git to manage my codes and fork others' ideas.<br>
I think it's amazing!!!<br>
